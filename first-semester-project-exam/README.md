## 🎓 The Story Behind It

This project was actually part of my **AltSchool Africa** coursework - a front-end project exam that challenged me to build a stopwatch that not only worked flawlessly but also felt great to use.  

The goal was to demonstrate:

- 🧩 **Front-end precision**  
- ⏱️ **Timing accuracy**  
- 📱 **Responsive UI behavior** across devices  
- 🎬 **Event-handling and animation** mastery with JavaScript  

Every part of it - from formatting milliseconds to toggling dark mode - was coded from scratch using **vanilla JavaScript**, ensuring I understood each concept deeply.
