        <h3>Why I joined Altschool Africa?</h3>
        <p>
            I joined Altschool Africa because I am working the path of becoming a fullstack 
            software engineer, a better one. I also specifically choose AltSchool, firstly because
            of the BYBIT scholarship offer, then becuase Altschool Africa looks like the right place
            to learn and grow as a software engineer. I mean I believe so.
